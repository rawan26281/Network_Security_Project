# Advanced Network Security Architecture Implementation

**NTI EME 4M Final Project**

This project showcases a comprehensive implementation of a secure enterprise network using Cisco technologies.

## 🔐 Project Overview

Designed and implemented a secure network architecture featuring:

- **Cisco ASA Firewall** configuration to inspect and filter traffic
- **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)** to detect and block malicious activity
- **IPsec VPNs** for encrypted and secure remote communication
- **OSPF authentication** to enforce routing security and prevent route injection
- **AAA protocols (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)** to manage access control
- **Layer 2 security techniques** to protect against:
  - VLAN Hopping
  - MAC Spoofing

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Cisco ASA
- GNS3 (optional, if used)
- Networking protocols: OSPF, AAA, IPSec
